This project provides modified firmware based on the original source provided by David Turnbull / AE9RB
The modified firmware now supports very low latency CW and Iambic code generation.

## Building Firmware

The project was built with PSoC Creator 3.1

It is normal to get errors about missing files until you have built
the project for the first time.  This is because the generated files
have been excluded from the git repository.
