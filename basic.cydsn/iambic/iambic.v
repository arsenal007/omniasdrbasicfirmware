//
// Inputs:
//    rst_n - Asynchronous reset input, internally synchronized to clk.
//    clk - input clock signal, active rising edge, 100 Hz nominal
//    speed - number of clock edges per dit.
//        speed = (f(clk) * 60) / (wpm * 50)     (Using PARIS standard timing.)
//        At 1000 Hz clk, 12 wpm is speed=100, 5 wpm is speed = 240, and 20 wpm is speed = 60
//    modeb - Mode B flag.  Set to 1 if operating in mode B, 0 if in mode A.
//    dit - dit paddle input
//    dah - dah paddle input
//
// Output:
//    key - Morse code keyed output
//
